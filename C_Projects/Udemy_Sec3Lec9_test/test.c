#include <stdio.h>

// can have void main, with no return,
// but pretty sure standard practice is to use
// int main with return, for good reasons,
// but can't remember what exactly

// int main actually works without return 0,
// although gives a warning

int main()
//void main()
{
    printf("How's things going?");
    return 0;
}
